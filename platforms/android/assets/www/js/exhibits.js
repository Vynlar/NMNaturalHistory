Discover New Mexico's state fossil, and one of the very first dinosaurs, Coelophysis. See the last of the giant amphibians and meet the terrors of the Triassicâ€”a 12-foot long predatory erythrosuchian and the crocodile-like phytosaurs. Explore the fossil evidence like a scientist in this highly interactive exhibit."],

It features a time when most of New Mexico was covered by an inland sea and urges you to consider what New Mexico was like 75 million years ago. The exhibit features a living tropical forest and fossils of marine animals, strange birds, early mammals, and dinosaurs. The dinosaur fossils include a jawbone with teeth from a T. rex, a partial skeleton of the tyrannosaur Daspletosaurus, and skulls of many other dinosaurs, including Parasaurolophus, Naashoibitosaurus, Sphaerotholus, and a tyrannosaur known as \"The Bisti Beast\".

This unique exhibit gives you the chance to travel deep into an active volcano, complete with flowing lava and sulfurous steam. Glowing panels explain the different parts of the volcano you experience, and highlight New Mexico's eruptive past. As you travel up and out of a magma chamber, a large case showcases the gems, minerals, and rocks formed by volcanic processes at various depths."],

Fossils, footprints, and murals document the changes that occurred as New Mexico began to acquire its modern appearance."],
