The exhibit features a living tropical forest and fossils of marine animals, strange birds, early mammals, and dinosaurs. The dinosaur fossils include a jawbone with teeth from a T. rex, a partial skeleton of the tyrannosaur Daspletosaurus, and skulls of many other dinosaurs, including Parasaurolophus, Naashoibitosaurus, Sphaerotholus, and a tyrannosaur known as \"The Bisti Beast\".

About 75 million years ago, this dinosaur would have cropped vegetation from the subtropical swamps near the shore of the Cretaceous sea that covered much of New Mexico. The name Pentaceratops means \“five-horned face,\” and all five can be seen on Spike—one over each eye, one on each cheek and one on the nose.

Volunteer preparators must complete a special training course to work in FossilWorks, which was funded through an appropriation from the New Mexico State Legislature. Presently Fossilworks focuses on another Jurassic site, the Peterson quarry, located on BLM land in central New Mexico. A father-son team, the Petersons first discovered the site in the 1960s. Since 1989, they have led dozens of excavations at the site, pouring in thousands of volunteer hours to excavate almost 70 jackets containing dinosaur bones and teeth. The most dramatic specimen from the Peterson quarry is a partial skeleton of the giant (40 ft/12 m long) theropod Saurophaganax. This partial skeleton was first prepared in Fossilworks and is now on display in the museum's Age of Supergiants (Jurassic) exhibit. Besides the actual fossil preparation work, the exhibition features text and illustrations about fossilization, Jurassic Period dinosaurs, and preparation."],

        "Explore your night sky!", 
        "The Hall of the Stars aims to explain how the night sky is organized. This exhibit encourages visitors to explore the sky at their own pace and learn many different astronomical concepts, from the changing of the seasons to types of deep sky objects that they can see from their own backyards. Rather than just showing the sky visible on any given night of the year, the Hall of the Stars allows visitors to see all of the year’s stars and constellations in the same way that a world map allows them to visualize the whole globe.  The most prominent 39 constellations are quilted onto the tapestry with UV-reactive thread.  By also including the celestial equator and the ecliptic, or the path that the sun takes through the sky, the map demonstrates the changing of the seasons. The 1,100 commonly-visible stars in the northern night sky are represented by individual LEDs.  358 of these represent the brightest stars of the night sky and are controlled by a program running on the interactive touch screen. The LEDs come in various color temperatures in order to demonstrate the variability of colors and brightness among stars.  110 LEDs represent Messier Objects, which are a collection of famous deep sky objects, including the Pleiades and the Orion Nebula.  These LEDs are green in order to differentiate them from the stars. The user interface presents information about the tapestry in an intuitive, layered format.  Using it, people can either explore the constellations and stars of the night sky or Messier Objects. In order to see moveable objects such as the moon and planets that cannot be implemented with fixed-position LEDs, The Sky Tonight is included in the exhibit. The Sky Tonight, a member of the Space Update suite, was developed by Rice University and is available to all museums at a very low cost."],

Stan is a Tyrannosaurus rex, one of the largest predatory dinosaurs of all time. He was a powerful, agile, bipedal killing machine. Forty feet long and 12 feet high at the hips, Stan weighed roughly 6 tons and hunted with an acute sense of smell, 3-D vision, and great speed powered by huge and muscular hind legs. A complete T. rex skeleton has yet to be found in New Mexico, however fossils of tyrannosaurid dinosaurs—Albertosaurus and Tyrannosaurus rex—have been discovered all over New Mexico from the San Juan Basin to Elephant Butte and Raton. T. REX ATTACK! is on permanent display in the Museum’s atrium and is free with regular Museum admission. T. REX ATTACK! is made possible by the generosity of the 2006 New Mexico State Legislature, the NMMNHS Volunteer Association, the NMMNH Foundation and numerous private donors."],

In 1997, a volunteer researcher, Paul Sealey, found an interesting site during a weekend fossil exploration fieldtrip to the Bisti/De-na-zin Wilderness Area. Paul Sealey has a long history of working with Museum curators to recover fossils. Dr. Williamson visited the new site and immediately realized that Paul Sealey had found a very rare and important fossil: the partial skeleton of a tyrannosaur, a member of the group of meat-eating dinosaurs that includes Tyrannosaurus rex. This was to be the first paleontological excavation to be allowed in a Federal Wilderness area. The permits were granted in 1998 and the dinosaur was excavated that summer. The completeness of the new tyrannosaur specimen was revealed only after careful preparation."],
